# COUNTERFIET-BANKNOTE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
# BanknoteClassificationModel
This project aims to determine the authenticity of a currency note based on various measures extracted from a photograph, distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit bills.

ALGORITHMS USED:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. K Nearest Neighbor
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Perceptron Learning

Machine learning libraries & module:
1. Scikit learn Library
2. csv module
3. random module

RESULT:The analysis of four distinct algorithms revealed that the KNN and SVM models outperform others in terms of accuracy for banknote authentication, achieving accuracies of 100% and 99.45%, respectively.

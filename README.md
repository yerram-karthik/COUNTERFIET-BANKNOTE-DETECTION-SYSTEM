# COUNTERFIET-BANKNOTE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
# BanknoteClassificationModel
The aim is to predict whether a given banknote is authentic or counterfeit given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHMS:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. K Nearest Neighbor
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Perceptron Learning



Machine learning libraries & module:
1. Scikit learn Library
2. csv module
3. random module


Result: I have compared four different algorithms in terms of accuracy and concluded that the KNN & SVM algorithms are the best algorithms for banknote authentication with an accuracy of 100% & 99.45%.
